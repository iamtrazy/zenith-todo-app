## 1. Introduction & Executive Summary

This document outlines the product requirements for "Zenith To-Do," a cross-platform desktop application designed for simple and elegant task management. The project's primary goal is to create a functional, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing to-do list application. Development will be executed through an AI-assisted "vibe coding" process, leveraging natural language prompts to generate code. The application will enable users to manage their daily tasks efficiently through core features like adding, editing, and deleting tasks, marking them as complete, and visualizing them in a calendar view. All data will be stored locally in an SQLite database, ensuring user privacy and offline functionality.

- **Product Name:** Zenith To-Do
- **Product Vision:** To be the most intuitive and visually calming desktop to-do application, built with a revolutionary AI-assisted development process.
- **Target Audience:** Students, freelancers, professionals, and anyone seeking a straightforward, offline-first desktop tool to organize their tasks without the complexity of larger project management systems.

## 4. Features & Functionality

### 4.1. Task Management (CRUD Operations)

#### 4.1.1. **Create Task**

- **Description:** Users must be able to add a new task to their list.
- **User Story:** As a user, I want to add a new task so I can keep track of what I need to do.
- **Requirements:**
  - An always-visible "Add Task" button (e.g., a floating action button).
  - Clicking the button shall open a modal/dialog or an inline form.
  - The form must include:
    - A text input field for the task title/description (required).
    - A date picker for an optional due date.
    - "Save" and "Cancel" buttons.
  - Saving the task shall add it to the main task list and persist it in the SQLite database.

#### 4.1.2. **Read/View Tasks**

- **Description:** Users must be able to view their list of tasks.
- **User Story:** As a user, I want to see all my pending tasks in a clear list so I can know what I need to work on.
- **Requirements:**
  - The main view of the application will display the list of all non-completed tasks.
  - Each task in the list must display:
    - A checkbox on the left.
    - The task title/description.
    - The due date, if one was set.
  - Tasks should be sorted by creation date by default (newest first).

#### 4.1.3. **Update/Edit Task**

- **Description:** Users must be able to edit the details of an existing task.
- **User Story:** As a user, I want to edit a task's description or change its due date because plans can change.
- **Requirements:**
  - Clicking on a task (or an associated "edit" icon) shall make its fields editable.
  - The user must be able to change the task title and the due date.
  - Changes must be persisted to the database upon saving.

#### 4.1.4. **Delete Task**

- **Description:** Users must be able to permanently remove a task.
- **User Story:** As a user, I want to delete a task that is no longer relevant to clear up my list.
- **Requirements:**
  - Each task item will have a "Delete" icon.
  - Clicking the "Delete" icon shall prompt the user with a confirmation dialog (e.g., "Are you sure you want to delete this task?").
  - Upon confirmation, the task will be removed from the UI and deleted from the database.

#### 4.1.5. **Mark Task as Completed**

- **Description:** Users must be able to mark a task as completed to track progress.
- **User Story:** As a user, I want to check off a task when I'm done with it so I can feel a sense of accomplishment.
- **Requirements:**
  - Clicking the checkbox next to a task shall mark it as complete.
  - A completed task's title should be visually distinct (e.g., have a strikethrough effect and faded color).
  - Completed tasks may be moved to a separate "Completed" list or filtered from the main view, with a toggle to show/hide them.
  - The "completed" status must be persisted in the database.

### 4.2. Calendar View

  - Users must be able to navigate to previous and next months.
  - Tasks with a set due date must appear as an event on the corresponding day in the calendar.
  - Clicking on a task in the calendar view could show its full details in a pop-up or modal.

### 4.3. Data Persistence

- **Description:** All user-generated tasks must be stored locally.
- **Requirements:**
  - The application must use an SQLite database file for all data storage.
  - The database will be created/initialized on the first application launch.
  - The application must save all changes automatically (no manual "save" button for the entire list).

## 6. Success Metrics

The success of the Zenith To-Do MVP will be measured by:

- **Feature Completeness:** 100% of the features listed in Section 4 are implemented and functional.
- **Stability:** The application runs without crashing and has no critical bugs related to the core functionality.
- **Build Success:** The application can be successfully packaged into distributable installers for Windows (.exe), macOS (.dmg), and Linux (.AppImage or .deb).
